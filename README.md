# ETH-balances-checker
To check the balance of Ethereum wallets, you'll need to use a web3 library that interacts with the Ethereum blockchain. One of the popular Python libraries for this purpose is web3.py. To run this script, make sure you have Python installed and install the web3.py library using pip.
pip install web3
# Here's a Python script that checks the balance of multiple Ethereum wallets:
scrypt.py
Make sure to replace 'YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID' with your actual Infura project ID. Additionally, update the wallet_addresses list with the Ethereum wallet addresses you want to check.

This script will print the balance of each wallet address in Ether (ETH). If there's an error while fetching the balance for a particular address, it will print the error message instead.
